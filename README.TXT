Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.


Value is always resetting the balance back to 0.

When you put too much it still puts the balance back to 0 it doesnt carry over the values.

When you put to little the Void Print Ticket method still works

The cents text inputs the value orginally entered into the called method.

public TicketMachine(int cost) (Constructor for the class)
GetPrice(method)
GetBalance(method)
InsertMoney(method)
printTicket(method)
price(field)
balance(field)
total(field)

yes the ordering of a field matters

The student class

2 constructors title and price
